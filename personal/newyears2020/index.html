  <p>Running by the numbers, 2019 was a pretty shitty years in terms of me being able to accomplish my goals. I had 5 goals for last year, to get back to doing jiujitsu, figuring out grad school, hitting top 10% for a kaggle competition, drop weight and become more social. Of these I accomplished 2/5, which is a 40% success rate. (Thanks to GRE prep, I can do simple math in my head now)</p>
<p>So let's do a quick run down of the 2 I did accomplish - I figured out what I'm doing about grad school. I took a sabbatical from Gramener, joined the research lab full time and worked towards getting an A* publication. I submitted to a conference, and promptly got rejected. While I'm still working on getting my own publication - I had a pretty decent end of the year; my work with the Delhi Government is ticking along pretty well and I've been contritbuting to a large number of projects in the lab. My sabbatical from Gramener ends in February - at the moment I'm leaning towards staying in academia till August. I also applied (am in the process of applying) to about fifteen different grad schools for a masters. So I'm pretty happy about that.</p>
<p>The second thing I accomplished was to be more social - since I moved back to Delhi, I've been under a fair amount of pressure - needing to help out with my mom and grandparents, cooking for them, making sure they take their medication, making sure they don't wander off in the middle of the night and a whole bunch of stuff like that. The only upside to having to do this is that it forces me to take a night off every week and be more social to make sure I don't go nuts.</p>
<p>Here's the downside - I still haven't gotten back to jiu jitsu, and I would say that the reasons I haven't are mostly mental. Put simply, I'm really afraid of going back too early; fucking up my knee again and being out for another year and a half. I've tried looking for a couple of sports medicine doctors/physiotherapists - not very hard though. Very recently, I've started working out three times a week and doing a lot of leg work to make sure it's strong enough when I do go back. This also relates to the other thing I've failed at last year - not only did I not loose any of the weight, I actually gained went and went up to 114 kilos. I'm finally back to a downward trajectory, but I seriously need to figure out how to deal with stress eating and learn to meal prep while living with my grandparents to make sure I drop all the excess weight this year.</p>
<p>Overall, last year was pretty messed up - while I finally took steps to move out of the feeling of limbo I had been feeling for a while, a bunch of family related issues made it very difficult to fully devote myself to work or anything else for that matter. Taking care of old people is hard fucking work. That being said, I made some new friends, started drinking again (and realized I'm not actually an alcoholic), read a lot of very interesting books and discovered some cool indian bands that I don't think I would have if I hadn't moved back to Delhi.</p>
<p>So, let's talk about what I want to accomplish this year.</p>
<p>In terms of personal health - this is probably the most straightforward. I want to drop 25 kilos by the end of the year; this would mean that by the 31st of December 2020, I want to be 89 kilos or less. I'm 6 down from my heaviest today. The second thing I want to do physically is be able to run a half marathon and do a hundred pushups. (I am nowhere near doing either at the moment). A huge part of this resolution is to find some way to deal with stress eating. I find that days that I'm feeling stressed, or have a hard day with my family, I end up wanting to crawl up in bed and eat something trashy. The measures that I've tried to stop doing this just haven't worked - ever since I stopped working out every day, I haven't found another outlet for shitty days, and my current family situation makes it kind of difficult to go to a gym everyday, but I'm going to make sure I get some sort of intense exercise everyday, even if it means I go to the nearest children's park and start doing burpees to amuse little kids.</p>
<p>Professionally, I'm hoping that I'm going to be starting a masters program somewhere in the world in August this year, if that happens I'm going to have about 2 years to get a couple of first author publications in big name conferences - <a href="https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1211526001110306817">by all accounts</a> it's required to get into top PhD programs anywhere in the world for ML. I'm not sure I want to do a PhD at the moment, but I'm very sure that I want to spend my masters being set up for one if I choose to do one two years from now. Doing this means 2 things, finding specific problems to solve and being able to write model code quickly and effectively. Problem finding is hard, and there isn't really a concrete way to quantify it I suppose, but by the end of this year I want to be able to thoroughly explore a minimum of 4 problems and work towards solving one. Writing model code on the other hand is relatively easier- I'm just going to spend 10 hours every week writing models in swift and pytorch and an additional hour every week writing about what I did. I'm also planning to release one long form technical blog post every month from things that I'm learning and using at work.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest goal I want to accomplish is to be able to get back to travelling again. I don't have a lot of free time these days, but a promise I'm making to myself is that the moment I'm done with college applications and delhi elections end I'm going to go somewhere I haven't been before for a week. It's probably going to be poorly planned and I'll end up spending a bomb, but fuck it.</p>
<p>It's scary how quickly time flies - this song is 10 years old now, holy shit.
