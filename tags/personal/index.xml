      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted. Since last Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working during the day, spending about 40% of my time taking care of my grandparents and spending my nights scrambling for resources. Tracking down oxygen, ventilators, hospital beds, home ICUs and god only knows what else.
My experience through covid so far had mainly been very sheltered. Last year, when the lockdowns were about to be announced, I grabbed a monitor from my desk at IIIT Delhi, moved in with my grandparents, and continued to live my life as a shutin.</description>

      <title>Delhi Protests</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to preface this by saying I know very little about politics.
However, irrespective of your view of the legality of CAB and NRC - the steps that The Indian Government is taking to quell these protests are completely inexcusable.
Shutting down Metro Stations, Imposing Section 144 and Preventing Internet/Mobile Access to prevent peaceful protests is excessive and should be illegal.
At the moment, There is no internet in parts of UP - Sahranpur, Muzaffarnagar, Aligarh and Sambhal.</description>

      <description>Picture the idyllic, perfect day. Warm, but not overly so. Sunny, but not enough to be oppressive.
Breathe.
Picture the lush, beautiful green grass slowly rushing towards you as a stranger yells the phrase FLARE FLARE FLARE into your ear. In your mind, some remnant of a Michael Schumacher interview is telling you to relax your body because anything kept braced will break.You should be panicking, but strangely, you&amp;rsquo;re extremely calm.</description>

      <description>For the second time in two years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve decamped and moved cities. Unexpectedly, there&amp;rsquo;s a fair amount of culture shock. In the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten accustomed to being in a very quiet city and Delhi is certainly not that. Plus I&amp;rsquo;ve had relatives over, other relatives passing away and social obligations that I can&amp;rsquo;t postpone, so things have been fairly busy; a far cry from how introverted I&amp;rsquo;d become in Hyderabad.</description>

      <description>Around this time last year, I had a few goals in mind for this year. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly write them down - and as most of my friends will attest, my memory isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, so I&amp;rsquo;m kinda winging it.
  Jiu Jitsu - My biggest goal at the start of the year, was to get all the weird shit with my head sorted out so I could go back to doing jiu jitsu.</description>

      <description>Four years ago, I sat behind Engineering Hall on campus at the University of Illinois and the enormity of my fuck-up struck for the perhaps the first time. Over the course of a long year and a half I had made a series of bad decisions that ended up in my dropping out of one the best ranked engineering programs in the world, returning to India and starting all over.</description>
