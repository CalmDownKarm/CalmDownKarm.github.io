      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to preface this by saying I know very little about politics.
However, irrespective of your view of the legality of CAB and NRC - the steps that The Indian Government is taking to quell these protests are completely inexcusable.
Shutting down Metro Stations, Imposing Section 144 and Preventing Internet/Mobile Access to prevent peaceful protests is excessive and should be illegal.
At the moment, There is no internet in parts of UP - Sahranpur, Muzaffarnagar, Aligarh and Sambhal.</description>

      <description>Picture the idyllic, perfect day. Warm, but not overly so. Sunny, but not enough to be oppressive.
Breathe.
Picture the lush, beautiful green grass slowly rushing towards you as a stranger yells the phrase FLARE FLARE FLARE into your ear. In your mind, some remnant of a Michael Schumacher interview is telling you to relax your body because anything kept braced will break.You should be panicking, but strangely, you&amp;rsquo;re extremely calm.</description>

      <description>For the second time in two years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve decamped and moved cities. Unexpectedly, there&amp;rsquo;s a fair amount of culture shock. In the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten accustomed to being in a very quiet city and Delhi is certainly not that. Plus I&amp;rsquo;ve had relatives over, other relatives passing away and social obligations that I can&amp;rsquo;t postpone, so things have been fairly busy; a far cry from how introverted I&amp;rsquo;d become in Hyderabad.</description>

      <description>Around this time last year, I had a few goals in mind for this year. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly write them down - and as most of my friends will attest, my memory isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, so I&amp;rsquo;m kinda winging it.
  Jiu Jitsu - My biggest goal at the start of the year, was to get all the weird shit with my head sorted out so I could go back to doing jiu jitsu.</description>

      <description>Four years ago, I sat behind Engineering Hall on campus at the University of Illinois and the enormity of my fuck-up struck for the perhaps the first time. Over the course of a long year and a half I had made a series of bad decisions that ended up in my dropping out of one the best ranked engineering programs in the world, returning to India and starting all over.</description>
